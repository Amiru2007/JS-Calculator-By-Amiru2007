# JS Calculator By Amiru2007

Scientific calculator powered by JavaScript. The calculator includes number buttons, a clear button, 5 operator buttons such as "Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Exponentiation", a backspace button, a dot button and a display to show the operations. I have used `input` tags to get the values into the display.

In addition, this calculator also has 5 other scientific operations. This calculator has Clear, Backspace, History, Percentage and Ï€ buttons. You can find the square root and cube root of a number using this calculator. I'am just working on this, I'll upload a youtube video soon.
